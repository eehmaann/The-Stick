They can create, edit, view, and mark their goals as complete.  And they can create, edit,
view and delete their workouts.

## Details for teaching team
Available users for the site are
Jill@harvard.edu
Jamal@harvard.edu
Jerry@harvard.edu
eaehmann@gmail.com each of these have the passwords helloworld
This was influenced by the project Foobooks.
Login is required, but a not logged in user can go to p4.ericehmann.me/areas/create 
and p4.ericehmann.me/conditions/create.  This was an initial aspect of the site, but
not one that I wanted to be obviously apparent.
The redirect to add Goals when a user who has none tries to add a workout was deliberate
